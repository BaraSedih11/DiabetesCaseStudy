This repository contains a training and prediction model, along with tuning and testing, to identify the best estimators and features for our dataset.

## Introduction


## Contents

- `Regression Metrics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of Random Forest using Python.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.
- `diabetes.csv`: This is the working dataset.


## Requirements
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/finding_donors.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Regression Metrics
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Regression Metrics.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how many regression metrics evaluates and training and tuning is implemented using Python.
